**Gallaya Angle ISO**  
Standing very firmly on the shoulders of Colemak-DH, here's Gallaya making use of that extra key on left bottom row, and moving Backslash to the "worst" position.

**Gallaya Matrix UK**  
Ergonomic keyboards such as the Microsoft Ergonomic have the left bottom row less staggered than the typical row stagger, resulting in a more ortholinear muscle memory. For those with that style of bottom left row on a UK English ISO form factor, Backslash retains it position between Left Shift and Q.
