Layouts for US English (ANSI)

**Gallaya Angle (ANSI)**  
Suffice to say, Angle mod is the only way to ANSI. Recommend Gallaya layout for ANSI keyboards, though does require use of sAngle Mod fingering.

**Gallaya Ortho US**
Ergonomic keyboards such as the Microsoft Ergonomic have the left bottom row less staggered than the typical row stagger, resulting in a more ortholinear muscle memory. For those with that style of bottom left row on a US English ANSI form factor.
