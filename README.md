# Gallaya

Essentially an amalgamation and portmanteau of layouts [Gallium](https://github.com/GalileoBlues/Gallium) and Maya.

Whilst Gallium and Maya don't have as low a *Single Finger Bigram* (SFB) percentage as SFB optimised layouts such as ISRT, whorf, or sind, but what metrics the former do better in are *Disjointed Single Finger Bigram* (DSFB), also known as *Single Finger Skipgrams* (SFS), and *Lateral Stretch Bigram* (LSB). Personally. As much as I prefer a low SFB percentage, I'd take a hit on SFBs if it meant other equally negatively preceived metrics were improved; resulting in a more balanced layout.

Gallaya takes the left hand of Gallium[^1] and the right hand of Maya[^1], working the remaining letters in the centre columns to balance metrics using ClemenPine's [keysolve-Web](https://clemenpine.github.io/keysolve-web/) tool.   
[^1]: Excludes centre columns.

*P.S. To save those curious the time, Mayium (Left hand Maya, Right hand Gallium, tweaking in the middle) doesn't statistically fair better than either of its parent layouts* 

Angle modded, `Z` would've remained in left first finger centre column position with `Q` in the "worst position" had angle mod been strictly adhered too. As `Z` is the least used letter in English, it's position was swapped with `Q`.

Also included is Angle Mod for ISO form factors; a homage to Colemak-DH and for fellow UK English users.
